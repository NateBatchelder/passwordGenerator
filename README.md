  ## Installation
  JavaScript: Password Generator is run from the browser and no programs need to be installed.

  ## Usage
  When users navigate to the password generator they interact with a series of force prompts that cue inputs for password criteria.  In the event that a user does not select the minimum requirements a the JavaScript executes a loop that prompts the user to correct the input fields appropriately.  Once the input criteria are satisfactorily entered, a random password is generated and written to the screen.

  ## Features
  Attention was paid when creating the program to protect against infinate loops and user imput. 
  
  ## Tests
  Feel free to not follow the instructions.  You should be returned to the beginning of the associated loop to correct your mistakes.
